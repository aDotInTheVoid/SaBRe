// Sanitizers intercept various function calls, look here:

// In various TLS models _Thread_local variables calls __tls_get_addr to resolve
// its value. Unfortunately these modes crash LLVM sanitizers in the above
// function. The LLVM sanitizers themselves actually use initial-exec to avoid
// this problem. initial-exec doesn't go through __tls_get_addr but rather uses
// the %fs register directly.
// In the current setup, we need "initial-exec" as runtime_syscall_router will
// be called during pthread initialization which will happen before the
// sanitizers initialization phase.
// TODO(andronat): Will the following create any issues with other libraries?
// e.g. overlapping offsets and thus writting/reading from wrong variables?
